    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      I am a self-motivated computer engineering student who enjoys working in
      dynamic environments. I would like to use my software development
      expertise to contribute to a project that will significantly impact and
      improve the lives of Canadians. As I wrap-up my professional internship
      year, I am seeking to join a new company for the summer of 2020 before I
      return to school and finish my degree.
