    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      I am a self-motivated computer engineering student who enjoys working in
      dynamic environments. I would like to use my software development
      expertise to contribute to a project that will significantly impact and
      improve the lives of Canadians. As I wrap-up my professional internship
      year, I am seeking to join a new company for the summer of 2020 before I
      return to school and finish my degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have designed this site to showcase the software development projects
      that I have worked on. If you would like to see what I am actively working
      on, check out my <a href="https://github.com/jmcdona1d">GitHub profile</a>{" "}
      where I try my best to make at least one contribution a day!
