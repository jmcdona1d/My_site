# My_site

This is a portfolio website to nicely showcase all of my development experience. It is made using Gatsby.js. Eventually it will be hosted publically to view - but for now to or edit it: clone/fork the repository, navigate to the directory `/Project_Portfolio` and run the command `gatsby develop`
