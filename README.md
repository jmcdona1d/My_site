# Developer Portfolio

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/781ae42e-6fc1-4277-a9b1-53d315c7511f/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/wizardly-banach-d52429/deploys)

This is a portfolio website to nicely showcase all of my recent development experience. It is made using Gatsby.js. To view or edit it locally: clone/fork the repository, navigate to the directory `/Project_Portfolio` and run the command `gatsby develop`

The website is also publically hosted at [jamesgmcdonald.com](https://jamesgmcdonald.com)
